Learning

The main aim of the AI component of my project was to develop an AI engine which could allow AI-controlled agents to utilise academic machine learning techniques in order to learn to navigate the game environment.

First problem: which technique to use.
- Decision tree
- Neural networks
- genetic programming
- reinforcement learning

Chose reinforcement learning:
- why
- benefits
- disadvantages(?)

An introduction to reinforcement learning: 

- action-reward
- MDPs
- overall summary of reinforcement 
- Bellman's Equation
- different algorithms:
	- Monte Carlo
	- Temporal Difference
	- Value & policy iteration
	- Q-learning
