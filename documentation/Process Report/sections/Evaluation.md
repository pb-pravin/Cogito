Evaluation

A very competent evaluation of the whole project (with hindsight). Weak performance in the evaluation of product and process will result in a grade no higher than a B.

Time Management
Initial plan was to use a waterfall development approach (discuss). Eventually took a slightly more incremental approach: developed game and AI together towards the end, some asset creation throughout. Discuss why, which would have been better - for one person rather than a team. As I was unfamiliar with the language and the engine, it was difficult to decide how best to approach the design/implementation.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Waterfall: a linear framework
			\item Incremental: a combined linear-iterative framework
			\item Spiral: a combined linear-iterative framework

	Achievements

	Areas For Enhancement
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Implement additional learning types
			\item Mixed learning types between agents
			\item Use a combination of types
			\item Communication between agents (shared knowledge base?)
			\item Extend to a 3D environment
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Overall Success}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Applications For Learning in games (possibly pre-release learning)
			\item Performance on mobile device
		\end{itemize}
