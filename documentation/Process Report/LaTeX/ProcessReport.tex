\section{Introduction/Introduction To Project}

The process report is where you discuss the process by which you carried out your project, which is an important aspect what is being examined. In it you should critically evaluate every significant area of your project area.

\subsection{To get an A grade}

	\subsubsection{Technical Grasp} 
	Excellent technical insight demonstrated to a professional level
	
	\subsubsection{Understanding of problem area}
	Showed professional level of insight into the whole area in which the project is embedded. 
	
	\subsubsection{Project Management}
	Completely successful and entirely self-managed
	
	\subsubsection{Report Quality}  
	Excellent - clear, substantial, fluent, correctly organised, convincing and with no omissions
	
	\subsubsection{Evidence of Learning}
	Mature reflection on the whole process, showing professional level of insight
	
	\subsubsection{Research Effort}
	Competent and thorough coverage of the field with excellent research in many areas. Research clearly influences outcomes   

Your choice of project, and how it fits in with the modules you have studied
	\subsection{Brief Description (history of Lemmings)}
	\subsection{Aims and Objectives}
	\subsection{How it Fits in with modules studied}
	AI modules, Game Development, Programming, OO Software Design/UML, Programming \& Concurrency, Formal Underpinnings/Maths, Computer Graphics Algorithms

\section{Artificial Intelligence [Background Research]}
(how research has influenced your decisions - there must be evidence of appropriate research)

	\subsection{AI In Games}
	\subsection{Acedemic Research}
	\subsection{Machine Learning/Applications}	
	\subsection{Why Use Machine Learning In Games}

	
\section{Choice of Tools [Background Research]}
Discuss your choice of tools, and the reasoning behind them (how research has influenced your decisions - there must be evidence of appropriate research).

	\subsection{Language}
	\subsection{Game Engine}
	\subsection{Software}
	\subsection{Source Control}

\section{Planning}
	\subsection{Initial Artwork}
	\subsection{UML/Class Diagrams}

\section{Social, Legal, Ethical and Professional Issues (Planning?)}
		\subsubsection{Intellectual Property}
		\subsubsection{Copyright Law}
		\subsubsection{The Data Protection Act}
		\subsubsection{Research Ethics}

\section{Implementation}
The progress you made, problems encountered, their solutions and the lessons learnt

	\subsection{Game Component}
		\subsubsection{Code Structure/Features}
		\subsubsection{Performance Optimisations}
		\subsubsection{Problems Faced/Fixes}
	\subsection{AI}
		\subsubsection{Code Structure/Features}
		\subsubsection{Performance Optimisations}
		\subsubsection{Problems Faced/Fixes}
	\subsection{Testing}

\section{Project Log/Git Commits}
A day-by-day work diary kept by you as the project is carried out. A log which has evidently been manufactured to be handed in rather than having been properly kept will result in a lower grade.
	
\section{Evaluation}
A very competent evaluation of the whole project (with hindsight). Weak performance in the evaluation of product and process will result in a grade no higher than a B.

	\subsection{Achievements}
	\subsection{Areas For Enhancement}
	\subsection{Overall Success}
