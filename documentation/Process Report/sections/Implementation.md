			Constants: Starting constants with a "k" is a legacy of the pre-Mac OS X days. In fact, I think the practice might even come from way back in the day, when the Mac OS was written mostly in Pascal, and the predominant development language was Pascal. In C, \#define'd constants are typically written in ALL CAPS, rather than prefixing with a "k".
