Introduction/Introduction To Project

The process report is where you discuss the process by which you carried out your project, which is an important aspect what is being examined. In it you should critically evaluate every significant area of your project area.

Project Proposal
The main aim of my project is to develop an AI system that is capable of employing machine learning techniques in order for a number of AI-controlled agents to safely navigate a game environment. The agents will be able to develop a knowledge-base dynamically based on the observations made whilst navigating the environment and apply this in order to traverse the world safely. The main deliverable will be a software-based demonstration of the system.

How it Fits in with modules studied
	
	I have utilised skills learned from the modules in my course to help me with developing my project.
	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{AI Modules}: obvious
			\item \textbf{Game Development}: obvious
			\item \textbf{Object Oriented Design \& Specification, Programming, Concurrency and Client-Server Computing}: Basic OO design, how to design a program well, and to be reusable using OO features; inheritance etc. as well as the more practical programming side of things. Also the UML side to design the system.
			\item \textbf{Formal Underpinnings \& Specification}:  Again, the more design-centric side - specifying the system.
			\item \textbf{Computer Graphics Algorithms}: Data structures, efficiency, time complexity.
			\item \textbf{Overall}: 
		\end{itemize}
