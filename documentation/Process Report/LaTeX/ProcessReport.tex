\section{Introduction}

The process report is where you discuss the process by which you carried out your project, which is an important aspect what is being examined. In it you should critically evaluate every significant area of your project area.

To get an A grade:

	\subsubsection{Technical Grasp} 
	Excellent technical insight demonstrated to a professional level
	
	\subsubsection{Understanding of problem area}
	Showed professional level of insight into the whole area in which the project is embedded. 
	
	\subsubsection{Project Management}
	Completely successful and entirely self-managed
	
	\subsubsection{Report Quality}  
	Excellent - clear, substantial, fluent, correctly organised, convincing and with no omissions
	
	\subsubsection{Evidence of Learning}
	Mature reflection on the whole process, showing professional level of insight
	
	\subsubsection{Research Effort}
	Competent and thorough coverage of the field with excellent research in many areas. Research clearly influences outcomes   

\section{Choice of Project/Aims}
Your choice of project, and how it fits in with the modules you have studied
	\subsection{Project Objectives}
	\subsection{How it Fits in}
		AI modules, Game Development, Programming, OO Software Design/UML, Programming & Concurrency, Formal Underpinnings/Maths, Computer Graphics Algorithms

\section{Background Research}
Your background research and how it's influenced your decisions. There must be evidence of appropriate research.

	\subsection{Acedemic Research}
	
	\subsection{Tools}
	Discuss your choice of tools, and the reasoning behind them.

		\subsubsection{Language}
		\subsubsection{Game Engine}
		\subsubsection{Software}

\subsection{Machine Learning}

\section{Planning}
	\subsection{Initial Artwork}
	\subsection{UML/Class Diagrams}
	\subsection{Social, Legal, Ethical and Professional Issues}
		\subsubsection{Intellectual Property}
		\subsubsection{Copyright Law}
		\subsubsection{The Data Protection Act}
		\subsubsection{Research Ethics}

\section{Implementation}
The progress you made, problems encountered, their solutions and the lessons learnt

	\subsection{Game Component}
	\subsection{AI}
	\subsection{Testing}
	
\section{Evaluation}
A very competent evaluation of the whole project (with hindsight). Weak performance in the evaluation of product and process will result in a grade no higher than a B.

	\subsection{Achievements}
	\subsection{Areas For Enhancement}
	\subsection{Overall Success}
	
\section{Project Log}
A day-by-day work diary kept by you as the project is carried out. A log which has evidently been manufactured to be handed in rather than having been properly kept will result in a lower grade.
