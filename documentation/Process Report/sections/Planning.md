**Analysis:** "a vague understanding of the problem is transferred into a precise description of the tasks that the software system needs to carry out."

Creation of a functional specification:
- Completely defines the tasks to be performed
- Free from internal contradictions 
- Can be tested against reality

The analysis phase concerns itself wit the description of what needs to be done, not how it should be done.

**Design:** the designer must structure the programming tasks into a set of interrelated classes. Each class must be specified precisely, listing both its responsibilities and its relationship to other classes in the system.

Main goals:
- Identify the classes
- Identify the responsibilities of these classes
- Identify the relationships among these classes

Not necessarily a complete process; not all classes may be discovered until implementation.

Components: 
- A textual description of the classes and their most important responsibilities
- Diagrams of the relationships among the classes
- Diagrams of important usage scenarios
- State diagrams of objects whose behaviour is highly state-dependant
