	Annote = {Discusses the technique of building intentional flaws into AI systems to add to the entertainment value of the game. Largely focussed around the standard shooter genre.

"Fun can be maxi- mized when mistakes made by computer opponents are intentional"

"As an AI programmer, it is easy to get caught up in the excitement of making an intelligent game character and to lose sight of the ultimate goal; namely, making an entertaining game"

"The hallmark of a good AI programmer is the ability to resist the temptation of adding intelligence where none is needed and to recognize when a cheaper, less complex solution will suffice"

"The hallmark of a good AI programmer is the ability to resist the temptation of adding intelligence where none is needed and to recognize when a cheaper, less complex solution will suffice. The challenge lies in demonstrating the NPC's skills to the player, while still allowing the player to win"

Tricks to building 'stupid' AI:
- Move Before Firing
- Be Visible
- Have Horrible Aim
- Miss the First Time
- Warn the Player
- Attack ``Kung-fu'' Style
- Tell the Player What You Are Doing
- React to Mistakes
- Pull Back at the Last Minute
- Intentional Vulnerabilities},

	Abstract = {This paper presents CBRetaliate, an agent that combines Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Unlike most previous work where RL is used to improve accuracy in the action selection process, CBRetaliate uses CBR to allow RL to respond more quickly to changing conditions. CBRetaliate combines two key features: it uses a time window to compute similarity and stores and reuses complete Q-tables for continuous problem solving. We demon- strate CBRetaliate on a team-based first-person shooter game, where our combined CBR+RL approach adapts quicker to changing tactics by an opponent than standalone RL.},

Research into using case-based reasoning to allow reinforcement learning to respond more quickly to to changing conditions. A definite focus on the implementation.

Gives a nice introduction to the use of reinforcement learning in games.

"In this paper we present CBRetaliate, an agent that uses Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques to enhance the Retaliate RL agent. Unlike most previous work where RL is used to improve accuracy in the case selection process, CBRetaliate uses CBR to jump quickly to previously stored policies rather than slowly adapting to changing conditions"

If the system is doing 'well', it stores the current case for later reference.

Some nice, in-depth discussion of the algorithms used in the research, as well as the reasoning behind them - could be useful for designing my own algorithms later (also some pseudocode examples).},

	Abstract = {Current approaches to adaptive game AI typically require numerous trials to learn effective behaviour (i.e., game adaptation is not rapid). In addition, game developers are concerned that applying adaptive game AI may result in un- controllable and unpredictable behaviour (i.e., game adaptation is not reliable). These characteristics hamper the incorporation of adaptive game AI in commercially available video games. In this article, we discuss an alternative to these current approaches. Our alternative approach to adaptive game AI has as its goal adapting rapidly and reliably to game circumstances. Our approach can be classified in the area of case-based adaptive game AI. In the approach, domain knowledge required to adapt to game circumstances is gathered automatically by the game AI, and is exploited immediately (i.e., without trials and without resource- intensive learning) to evoke effective behaviour in a controlled manner in online play. We performed experiments that test case- based adaptive game AI on three different maps in a commercial RTS game. From our results we may conclude that case-based adaptive game AI provides a strong basis for effectively adapting game AI in video games.},
	Annote = {Summary:

Discusses an alternative method to learning which functions without trials and without resource- intensive learning. Uses a downoaded 'case base' of previously played games to develop a strategy.

Some nice discussion on the different types of learning found in games (adaptive AI, difficulty scaling etc.)

Mostly focussed towards Real-Time Strategy games.

Very nice in-depth descriptions (with examples) of the implementation of the learning.

Nice description of what constitutes an entertaining game:
"The purpose of a typical video game is to provide en- tertainment [1], [4]. Naturally, the criteria of what makes a game entertaining is dependent on who is playing the game. The literature suggests the concept of immersion as a general measure of entertainment [5], [6]. Immersion is the state of consciousness where an immersant's awareness of physical self is diminished or lost by being surrounded in an engrossing, often artificial environment [7]. Taylor argues that evoking an immersed feeling by a video game is essential for retaining a player's interest in the game [6]. As such, an entertaining game should at the very least not repel the feeling of immersion from the player [8]. Aesthetical elements of a video game such as graphical and auditory presentation are instrumental in establishing an immersive game environment."

"it is not uncommon that a game has finished before any effective behaviour could be established, or that game characters in a game do not live sufficiently long to benefit from learning"

"in our approach we consider that the challenge that is provided by the game AI should be adaptable to fit individual players"

Adaptation mechanism:
// Offline processing
A1. Game indexing; calculate indexes for all stored games.
A2. Clustering of observations; group together similar observations.
// Initialisation of game AI
B1. Establish the (most likely) strategy of the opponent player.
B2. Determine to which parameter−band values this opponent strategy can be abstracted.
B3. Initialise game AI with an effective strategy observed against the opponent with the most similar parameter−band values.
// Online strategy selection
C1. Use game indexes to select the N most similar games.
C2. Of the selected N games , select the M games that best satisfy the goal criterion .
C3. Of the selected M games , select the most similar observation .
C4. Perform the game strategy stored for the selected observation .},

Focuses on neuroevolution

Gives some examples of where machine learning has been used recently (early 00s)

Has a nice summary of research in the area including NEAT & NERO.

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) - evolving neural network appropriate for video games


Quotes:

"{\ldots}a large part of AI development is devoted to path-finding algorithms"

"a large part of the gameplay in many games is figuring out what the AI is programmed to do and learning to defeat it"

Evolutionary computation: "Each solution is evaluated in the task and assigned a fit- ness based on how well it performs. Individuals with high fitness are then reproduced (by crossing over their encodings) and mutated (by randomly changing components of their encodings with a low probability). The offspring of the high-fitness individu- als replace the low-fitness individuals in the popula- tion, and over time, solu- tions that can solve the task are discovered"

"Neuroevolution is particularly well suited to video games because (1) it works well in high-dimensional spaces; (2) diverse populations can be maintained; (3) individual networks behave consistently; (4) adaptation takes place in real time; and (5) memory can be implemented through recur- rency (Gomez et al., 2006; Stanley et al., 2005)"

"Entirely new game genres can be developed, such as machine-learning games, in which the player explicitly trains game agents to perform vari- ous tasks"

"To rtNEAT, [the sliders] represent coefficients for fitness components. For exam- ple, the sliders specify how much to reward or punish agents for approaching enemies, hitting targets, getting hit, following friends, dispersing, etc."},

	Abstract = {With its latest release ``Black and White'', Lionhead Studios has set the new standard for artificial intelligence in games. Creatures in this game have an incredible ability to learn that is implemented through a variety of AI algorithms and techniques. There is much that could be added to the game given ample time and computing resources. These additions include a partial order planner for creatures' actions, a game-state search algorithm and planner for a computer-controlled opponent, and a dynamic lookup table to create better battling creatures.},
	Annote = {Summary:

Gives a nice history of video games with respect to their use of AI. Started in the mid-sixties with Pong (and similar)

A nice description of the type of AI techniques used in Black & White:
-Example of a decision tree/weighting of actions
- Richard Evens (Black & White AI developer) ``A decision tree is built by looking at the attributes which best divide the learning episodes into groups with similar feedback values. The best decision tree is the one that minimizes entropy, a measure of how disordered the feedbacksare. Thealgorithmusedtodynamicallyconstructdecision-treesto minimize entropy is based on (Ross) Quinlan's ID3 system."

	Abstract = {Artificial intelligence research and video games are a natural match, and academia is a fertile place to blend game production and academic research. Game development tools and processes are valuable for applied AI research projects, and university departments can create opportunities for student-led, team-based project work that draws on students' interest in video games. The Digital Media Collaboratory at the University of Texas at Austin has developed a project in which academic AI research was incorporated into a video game production process that is repeatable in other universities. This process has yielded results that advance the field of machine learning as well as the state of the art in video games. This is a case study of the process and the project that originated it, outlining methods, results, and benefits in order to encourage the use of the model elsewhere.},
	Annote = {Summary:

Outlines a university-led AI project at University of Texas. NeuroEvolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) project looks at the evolution of neural networks with a genetic algorithm.

"In NERO, a player trains a group of ignorant robot soldiers by setting learning objectives for the group through an interface. After the objective is set, the robots learn in real time to achieve their goal"

NERO has a real-time training stage which is carried out before the actual game. Player can 'save' the team, and start the game, when learning is no longer taking place.

- Documents the development process
- Used the Torque game engine (Garage Games)
- Use a 'spiral' method of development (design choices made iteratively)},
